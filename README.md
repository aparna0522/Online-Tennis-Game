Tennis is an arcade game which is played using paddles (racquets). 
<br>This project is made keeping in mind a single player and it's opponent as an computer bot. <br>The left paddle is being controlled by a player who uses his mouse to control the paddle, whereas the right paddle decides it's moves based on the tennis ball's position on the canvas.  
A player scores a point when his opponent misses to strike the ball.
